# Sales Forecasting using ML

Sales forecasting plays a vital role in the business sector in every field. With the help of the sales forecasts, sales revenue analysis will help to get the details needed to estimate both the revenue and the income. Different types of Machine Learning techniques such as Ridge Regression, Decision Tree, Simple Linear Regression, Random Forest and XGBoost Model have been evaluated on sales data to find the critical factors that influence sales to provide a solution for forecasting sales. After performing metrics such as accuracy, mean absolute error, and max error, the XGBoost is found to be the appropriate algorithm with accuracy of 61.97% according to the collected data and thus fulfilling the aim of this project.
