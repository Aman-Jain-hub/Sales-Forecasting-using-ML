# Sales Forecasting using ML

FLOW DIAGRAM - 

We used pandas library to analyze the data. Matplotlib & Seaborn to visualize the data and scikit learn for statistical modeling. First we import the modules and load our dataset using pandas library. Then we will preprocess the data.

Data preprocessing is divided into four stages: data cleaning, data integration, data reduction, and data transformation. Data preprocessing has the objective to add missing values, aggregate information and label data with categories (Data binning). We removed the outliers and created some new attributes. The next step is to understand and visualize the data. We used histograms, density and scatterplot for visualizing our data. We then created a correlation matrix. A correlation matrix is a basically a table which shows correlation coefficients between variables.

Conclusion -

Sales forecasting plays a vital role in the business sector in every field. With the help of the sales forecasts, sales revenue analysis will help to get the details needed to estimate both the revenue and the income. Different types of Machine Learning techniques such as Ridge Regression, Decision Tree, Simple Linear Regression, Random Forest and XGBoost Model have been evaluated on sales data to find the critical factors that influence sales to provide a solution for forecasting sales. After performing metrics such as accuracy, mean absolute error, and max error, the XGBoost is found to be the appropriate algorithm with accuracy of 61.97% according to the collected data and thus fulfilling the aim of this project.
